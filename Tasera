During studies I was part of a project team where we updated a scheduling system for a shooting range 
(Tampereen seudun ampumaratayhdistys ry). We were fifth team to do project work for this company (version V) 
and did our part in the beginning of 2022. 
I was junior developer in the team and my responsibility was to translate all the texts to Swedish 
and with other student to enhance the UI.

JavaScript and SCSS were used for this.
