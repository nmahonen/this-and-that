# this-and-that
Collection of things to show.

This repository contains some examples of scripts or prototypes or other projects of mine (or where I have been part of).
Here in this README.md you can find some prototypes made with Figma. Other files contain some applications or examples of
codes written with for example React or Python.

Figma prototypes:
1. Study related project - kind of travel booking site (first created at 2021 so you can maybe see
some influence of covid-19):
